It wasn\'t an explosion, but a rapid expansion of space itself from an infinitely hot, dense point.

As it cooled, a crust formed, volcanoes released gases to create an atmosphere, and water from comets and asteroids formed the oceans where life began.', thumbnail: '/images/topics/earth-evolution.jpg' },

A total eclipse reveals the Sun\'s ethereal outer atmosphere, the corona. This happens due to a cosmic coincidence: the Sun is 400 times larger than the Moon, but also 400 times farther away.', thumbnail: '/images/topics/solar-eclipse.jpg' }
